# Repository Guidelines

This project is developed with the help of the Codex agent. Follow these rules when contributing:

- Keep the `README.md` up to date. Update the task list whenever new work is planned or completed.
- When adding code for the Chrome extension, keep all source files at the repository root or within clearly named folders.
- Run `npm run lint` and address any issues before committing if a linter is available.
- Summaries in pull requests should mention changes to the task list and any new features.

These guidelines apply to the entire repository.
